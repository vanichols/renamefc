### The Rename Fremont County logo is inspired by the wonderful flag of Fremont County, Colorado!

* We chose our logo because it is a shining example of what can be produced using community-inclusive approaches to county level creative endeavors
* Read more about the flag on the [Fremont County website](https://fremontcountyco.gov/fremont-county-flag)
