### Renaming a county that is named after a controversial individual is important for several reasons

1. The names of places often reflect the values and history that a community or society wants to honor. Keeping names that glorify controversial individuals can perpetuate a negative legacy and suggest tacit approval of their actions.
2. Renaming places can help create a more inclusive environment. It recognizes the experiences and suffering of those who were negatively impacted by the actions of the individuals in question. It's a way to show respect and acknowledge past injustices.
3. Changing names can spark important conversations about history and prompt a re-evaluation of the figures we choose to honor. It encourages learning about the true impacts of historical figures and the values they embodied.
4. Society evolves, and so do our standards of what is considered acceptable and honorable. Renaming places is a way to reflect contemporary values and strive for a more equitable future.
